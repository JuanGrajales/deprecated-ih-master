/**
 * Canvas
 * - Canvas is used to draw 2d graphics with JavaScript
 * - <canvas> only has two attributes: width and height (the default for these values are w: 300 and h:150)
 * - DO NOT set the canvas width and height through CSS. CSS doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas; thus, it will appear distorted
 * 
 * Initial setup
 * - index.html with canvas tag and linking the JS file
